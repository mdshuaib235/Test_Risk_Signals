X-TIMESTAMP: 1707550000
X-SIGNATURE: generated_hmac

Backend Logic (Step-by-Step)
    Validate API key
    Fetch api_secret
    Recalculate HMAC
    Validate timestamp (±5 minutes)
    Fetch registered app by:
    bank_id
    package_name
    Compare:
        certificate_sha256 from DB
        certificate_sha256 from request

🔐 SECURITY ASSUMPTION

Bank backend sends headers:

X-API-KEY
X-SIGNATURE
X-TIMESTAMP
X-NONCE
Content-Type: application/json

Signature is created by:
    SHA256(request_body + timestamp + nonce)
    Then signed using bank private RSA key

You verify using stored bank.public_key.
